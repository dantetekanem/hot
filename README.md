How to use:

First, open the file config.php and edit the configurations as you like, the default directory to images are the "images/", but it's optional, you just need to appoint the new one on the config.php file

After that, just upload all your images to the images directory and enjoy HOT.
You can customize the design using the index.php file (please maintain the basic structure to the ajax callbacks) and css/hot.css file to update the stylesheets.

HOT is free to use.

Thanks and enjoy!
